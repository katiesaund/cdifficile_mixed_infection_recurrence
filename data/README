Notes on the MLST_report from Ali Pirani (who generated it): "ND: represents Not determined, A star next to any ST call indicates that there was some uncertainty in ST calling (such as heterozygous SNPs are detected, the percent of the gene called or percent identity is less than 100, or there is more than one contig in the assembly)"
